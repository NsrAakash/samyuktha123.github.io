👩‍💻 About Me

I am an Embedded / Automotive Software Engineer with experience in:

Embedded firmware development

FreeRTOS-based systems

Automotive ASPICE processes (SWE 1–4)

Static code analysis and safety standards

🔥 Project 1: Honeywell Notifier Fire Panel

Embedded Firmware & Hardware Integration

Project Overview

This project is based on FreeRTOS and focuses on reliable communication between fire sensors and a notifier panel.

Key Concepts

Multi-threaded design using FreeRTOS

Sensor data acquisition and panel display handling

Custom communication protocol between devices and panel

Wired communication with support for future wireless mesh expansion

My Contributions

Implemented separate threads for sensor handling and panel updates

Tested firmware using SD card mock mode

Compiled and configured firmware using IRS Configuration Tool

Loaded firmware into Embedded Linux and panel hardware

Implemented:

Device auto-learning

Acknowledgment mechanism to avoid crashes

Caching to improve performance

Enabled RS232 panel-to-panel communication (Master–Slave)

Supported alarms, indicators, reset, and silence alarm controls

Technologies & Tools

FreeRTOS

Embedded C

Embedded Linux

RS232

SD Card Booting

IRS Configuration Tool

📝 Note: All connections in this project are wired. A wireless gateway can be added by implementing mesh-based communication.
